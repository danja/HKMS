    <h1>Hyperdata Knowledge Management System</h1>


    <section class="three-column">
        <div>
            <p>A set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a>-oriented browser apps. It
                could be described as a <strong><a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_content_management_system">Headless
                        CMS</a></strong> where the notion of <em>Content</em> is expanded.</p>

            <p>It's a one-person effort by me, <a href="https://danny.ayers.name/">Danny Ayers</a>, though totally
                sitting on
                the laps of giants. It has quite a long <a href="https://hyperdata.it/history.html">history</a>.
            </p>

            <p>By expressing the data in RDF and interacting with an <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL
                    store</a> (I'm using Fuseki) the same underlying data (and potentially any other Linked Data) can be
                used
                across many different user interfaces. </p>

            <p>The knowledge management system I want is one that will directly help my projects. Simple version - I
                have a todo
                list (graph). Each item has resources associated with it that are only a click away. The system tells me
                what to do next to make the best use of my time/resources.</p>
            <p>The links in the navigation bar above are things that I'm developing and/or using. May well not do much.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/foowiki/">FooWiki</a> - A wiki. But I've been using Joplin (and before that Obsidian),
                    things will
                    be changing a little </li>
                <li><a href="/trellis">Trellis</a> - hierarchical lists. </li>
                <li><a href="/farelo/src/TurtleEditor/">TurtleEditor</a> - low-level editing of the data, with node and
                    arc graph visualization (I found it abandoned on GitHub)</li>
                <li><a href="/foowiki/gloss">Gloss</a> - this will be an AI glossary. But the motivation is mostly to
                    get
                    FooWiki code to do something a bit different, meanwhile I update the code</li>
                <li><a href="/foolicious">foolicious</a> - doesn't look like I've got what I thought I had, but this
                    will be a
                    URL bookmarker that scrapes a bit of info from the target docs</li>
                <li><a href="https://hyperdata.it/newsmonitor/">NewsMonitor</a> - a headless RSS aggregator (in Java,
                    uses Jena)</li>
                <li><a href="https://hyperdata.it/trev/">trev</a> - a low-level RDF editor (via SPARQL)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Right now I'm building/updating all of these simultaneously, so any/all could be broken. They share the
                same backend SPARQL Store and essentially the same architecture, which I'm calling <a
                    href="https://hyperdata.it/sparql-diamonds/">SPARQL Diamonds</a>. As I move forward them
                individually I'm trying to align to some common libs.
            </p>

            <p>Other bits and pieces that are around here include :</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/danja/y-mirror">y-mirror</a> - customised codemirror with y.js</li>
                <li><a href="/farelo/jupyterlite/j/lab/index.html">jupyterlite</a> - that Jupyter. Is plenty to do
                    sandboxed coding experiments</li>
