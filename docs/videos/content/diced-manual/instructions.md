# Getting Things Diced

The purpose of this kit is to help you carry out tasks you have getting around to by disrupting procrastination. The idea is that using the kit is a little fun, so the barrier to starting actions is lessened. Then a task is chosen for you, avoiding the mental block of deciding what can do. Finally a little extra motivation is given because the kit has instructed you to carry out the task.

Because the value of the sum of two dice has varying probability, it is possible to make higher priority tasks more probable, while including the chance of being told to do a fun activity. It is very probable that all the tasks will be carried out *eventually*.

This is not intended to be a strict procedure, just a way of nudging yourself in the right direction. Feel free to ignore the rules or adapt them as they better suit your preferences.

## Components

**Laminated sheets :**

* These instructions
* A sheet headed 'Tasks'
* A sheet headed 'Diced'

**Things on strings :**

* A whiteboard marker
* A cloth to erase whiteboard
* A bag containing a par of dice

## Procedure

*There is a slight difference between the first time you follow this procedure and subsequequent times which will be explained below. For the first time, just proceed from 1.*

1. Label the 'Task' sheet at the top with the area of activity it will cover, eg. 'Kitchen' for jobs to do in the kitchen.
2. The 'Task' sheet has two grids. On the upper grid list all the more important tasks, especially those which are difficult or unpleasant and you don't enjoy doing. Don't worry about the order, jst write down everything you can think of. Aim for at least 5 items. Don't worry about the amount of time each individual task will take or how frequently it has to be done (include things that only have to be done once).

e.g. :

* feed the cats
* clean table
* tidy surfaces
* clean floor
* do the washing up
* wrap Auntie Mabel's birthday present
...

3. On the lower grid on the 'Task' sheet list tasks associated with the area of activity that are easy, you enjoy doing. Include things that are just pleasant activities. Aim for at least 3 items. 

e.g. :

* organise cutlery drawer
* fry some bacon
* have a drink of fruit juice
* watch TV
...

4. Now take the 'Diced' sheet. Ignoring everything else on the sheet, fill in the 'Task' column based on the entries you have made on the 'Task' sheet. Put higher priority jobs towards the top of this list, lower ones lower. Don't worry if you have more or less items on the 'Task' list than will fit, and the ordering isn't very important as long as you include everything that you really should do. 

e.g.

* clean table
* do the washing up
* have a drink of fruit juice
* wrap Auntie Mabel's birthday present
* feed the cats
* clean floor
* watch TV
...

5. In the column marked 'L' (lower bound) you can put a duration for the **minimum** amount of time you should spend on this task for it to be worthwhile. Often this may not be appropriate, or you may simply prefer to leave this entry blank. Opening the cat food and not putting it in a bowl doesn't make much sense.
For example, something like 20 (minutes) might be appropriate for tidying surfaces. It'll be enough to make a useful difference but not likely to bore you to tears.

6. In the column marked 'H' (higher bound) you can put a **maximum** duration if it's a task that could take a long time but you don't want to do it all at once. e.g. for 'clean floor' you might put 15 (mins). Or you can leave this field blank.

7. Roll both dice and count the visible dots on top. 

8. Find the value in the 'Dice' column and do the corresponding task in that row, with reference to the 'L' and 'H' values. If you haven't got a task in that row or for some reason it isn't possible to carry out the task at this point in time, simply roll the dice again.

9. If the task was something that only ever needed doing once (it's Auntie Mabel's 100th birthday and she's not been well), erase the contents of that row on the 'Diced' sheet and its listing on 'Tasks'. If the task is something that doesn't need doing very frequently, put an 'X' in the 'X' (hold) column. When you next follow the procedure, if you land on this row, roll the dice again.

10. GOTO 1.
