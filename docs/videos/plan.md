My time : 50% working on the content, 50% on the media

make topics playlists


Blog posts and videos (podcasts, and..?)


also curate a list of links to useful resouces. (Awesome)

semi-scripted, mixed style,

2 x 15 min or 1 x 30 min a week - scheduled (Friday am?) - per topic (3 a week is a lot)

if in the mood, add extra material at the end - random stuff, my life, style of Cody wandering around

Shorts - at least 2 a week


Patreon mostly a tip jar.
Patreon subscribers can direct where I go in terms of content and style and get video responses to questions.
Merch raffles.

Bootstrap it with people I know, $1 a month.

Launch when I have 2+ vids prepared

review every 6 months
