Management System</h1>
<p><strong><em>celebrating 20 years of vapourware</em></strong></p>
<p>I'm currently rearranging things. This is actually the history.</p>
<p>Current activity is at : <a

<p>Hyperdata Knowledge Management System (HKMS) is the current working
title of a personal project I've been working on for a long time.</p>
<p>Skip down to '<strong>Components</strong>' if you wish to avoid the
ramblings of an old man.</p>
<h2 id="wayback">WayBack</h2>
<p>HKMS's first incarnation was <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040321215405/http://www.ideagraph.net/">Ideagraph</a>,
intended as a <em>Personal Knowledge Management System</em>.</p>
<p><img

alt="screenshot" /></p>
<p>Its purpose was :</p>
<ul>
<li>idea brainstorming and development</li>
<li>idea communication</li>
<li>knowledge sharing</li>
<li>project planning</li>
<li>document organization</li>
<li>semantic web blogging</li>
<li>syndicated news reading, processing and republishing</li>
</ul>
<p>That might sound like an outrageously wide scope, especially for a
lone coder. It was, but it was surprising how far I got in a relatively
short period of time as an unexceptional coder. The nearest it got to
being finished was the desktop Java app in the screenshot above (<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040402085138/http://www.ideagraph.net/2003-06/screenshots.htm">other
screenshots</a>).</p>
<p>The reason this even remotely possible was that all of these things
could share many common components. Critically, they could share the
same data model.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-model">The Data Model</h3>
<p><em>A little personal history for context. I'd been interested in AI
since seeing</em> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)">2001 A
Space Odyssey</a> <em>as a kid, reading Asimov books. I got into
electronics and computing as a teenager.</em> <em>My first computer was
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET">Commodore
PET</a> onto which I once typed in a Tick-Tack-Toe AI from a magazine.
Years later, at University, I took modules in neural nets and expert
systems.</em> <em>Later still, I got online and had a day job at a
college that included looking after the network, user support, database
admin etc. But it did give me machines to play with</em></p>
<p><em>Around 1999 I stumbled upon. This seemed to connect the dots
between the interesting AI bits and the Web. At the time I was clueless
at both ends, but the rdf-dev mailing list was very friendly, and I
gradually picked bits up.</em></p>
<p>The <em>Resource Description Framework</em> <a
href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> is a set of models and syntaxes
for expressing arbitrary data in a form that is natively compatible with
the Web. A clue is in the name : <strong>Resource</strong> in this
context is the same as the <strong>R</strong> in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>. A resource is simply
anything that you can identify. A real-world thing, a concept, or more
typically on the Web, a document. The neat trick that RDF brings to the
table is that you can also identify relationships between things and
treat them as resources in their own rights.</p>
<p>Given a model that can identify things and describe relationships
between them, you can build networks of information, more commonly known
as <strong>knowledge graphs</strong>. These are versatile enough to be
able to express pretty much any can of data you might wish to use on a
computer. The practicalities of this can get a bit involved depending on
what you're trying to do, but conceptually it's trivial.</p>
<p>Looking back at the list I had for Ideagraph : ideas, projects,
blogs, documents... - all things expressible in RDF. Together, standard
Java (using Swing for UI) and the nascent <a
href="https://jena.apache.org/">Apache Jena</a> framework had all the
tools I needed to code something up.</p>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<p>RDF provides a model that can represent pretty much anything. It has
various serialization formats so the data can be put in text. But like
CSV files, this isn't very user-friendly.</p>
<p>So I wanted to make visualizing and editing RDF a lot more user
friendly. In Ideagraph I had three main ways of looking at the RDF:</p>
<ul>
<li>text - view source of a particular bit of the RDF, or view/edit a
text description that was a property of a node</li>
<li>tree - a collapsible tree view, similar to those used in file
explorers (loops would just keep expanding)</li>
<li>graph - a node &amp; arc nextwork view</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't remember how far I'd got with implementation, but I also had
more dedicated views for :</p>
<ul>
<li>Project - a view structure around a <a
href="https://hyperdata.it/xmlns/project/index.htm">vocab</a> designed
for describing projects</li>
<li>Channels - for RSS feeds</li>
<li>Vocabs - for RDFS</li>
<li>Commands - an interpreter (I forget what I used for this, may have
been an ad hoc DSL or some standard language interpreter)</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>
