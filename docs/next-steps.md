Tests

Ask yoursely why you're doing this and what you want to get out of it.

Read Martin Fowler's Refactoring (again)

If it works, provably works, and change doesn't deliver a tangible benefit, don't change it.

I’d probably start by building it and running it, running tests, profiling it (I tend to use execution stats to guide code archaeology « what is it actually running? »).

- follow 300s

* translate posts to markdown - check server cleansing, update client

- check config is coming from text file

¯ batch add feeds (for me)

- secure updates

- update libs

* ping Marshall - ask for list of feeds, explain danny hobby, also data source, tell him it may be a useful source, uncurated, he could even put a page on aiTTENTION that pulls from the same data, filtered it as he wants - when it's more stable!
