# Hyperdata Knowledge Management System

**_celebrating 20 years of vapourware_**

Hyperdata Knowledge Management System (HKMS) is the current working title of a personal project I've been working on (and off) for about 20 years.

Its first incarnation was [Ideagraph]((https://web.archive.org/web/20040321215405/http://www.ideagraph.net/) (on archive.org).

Its purpose was :

- idea brainstorming and development
- idea communication
- knowledge sharing
- project planning
- document organization
- semantic web blogging
- syndicated news reading, processing and republishing
