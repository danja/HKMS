# Hyperdata Knowledge Management System

**_celebrating 20 years of vapourware_**

Hyperdata Knowledge Management System (HKMS) is the current working title of a personal project I've been working on for a long time.

Skip down to '**Components**' if you wish to avoid the ramblings of an old man.

## WayBack

HKMS's first incarnation was [Ideagraph](https://web.archive.org/web/20040321215405/http://www.ideagraph.net/).

Its purpose was :

- idea brainstorming and development
- idea communication
- knowledge sharing
- project planning
- document organization
- semantic web blogging
- syndicated news reading, processing and republishing

That might sound like an outrageously wide scope, especially for a lone coder. It was, but it was surprising how far I got in a relatively short period of time as an unexceptional coder. The nearest it got to being finished was the desktop Java app in the screenshot above ([other screenshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20040402085138/http://www.ideagraph.net/2003-06/screenshots.htm)).

The reason this even remotely possible was that all of these things could share many common components. Critically, they could share the same data model.

### The Data Model

_A little personal history for context. I'd been interested in AI since seeing [2001 A Space Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)) as a kid, reading Asimov books. I got into electronics and computing as a teenager.\_ _My first computer was a [Commodore PET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET) onto which I once typed in a Tick-Tack-Toe AI from a magazine. Years later, at University, I took modules in neural nets and expert systems._ _Later still, I got online and had a day job at a college that included looking after the network, user support, database admin etc. But it did give me machines to play with_

_Around 1999 I stumbled upon [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/). This seemed to connect the dots between the fun AI bits and the Web. At the time I was clueless at both ends, but the rdf-dev was very friendly, and I gradually picked bits up._
